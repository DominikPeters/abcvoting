-----------------------------------------

profile with 12 votes and 8 candidates:
 3 x {a, b},
 3 x {a, c},
 2 x {a, d},
 1 x {b, c, f},
 1 x {e},
 1 x {f},
 1 x {g}

Phase 1:

starting budget:
  (1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3)

adding candidate number 1: a
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 1/8
 remaining budget:
  (5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 5/24, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3)

Phase 2 (seq-Phragm√©n):

starting loads (= budget spent):
  (1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 0, 0, 0, 0)

adding candidate number 2: b
 maximum load increased to 11/32
 load distribution:
  (11/32, 11/32, 11/32, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 1/8, 11/32, 0, 0, 0)
 tie broken in favor of b,
 candidates {b, c} are tied (for any of those, the new maximum load would be 11/32).

adding candidate number 3: c
 maximum load increased to 55/128
 load distribution:
  (11/32, 11/32, 11/32, 55/128, 55/128, 55/128, 1/8, 1/8, 55/128, 0, 0, 0)
