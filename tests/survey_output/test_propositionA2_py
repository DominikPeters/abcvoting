------------
1st profile:
------------

profile with 10 votes and 3 candidates:
 2 x {a},
 3 x {a, c},
 3 x {b, c},
 2 x {b}

winning committees for k=1 and k=2:
----------------------------------
Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)
----------------------------------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

starting with the empty committee (score = 0)

adding candidate number 1: c
 score increases by 6 to a total of 6

Optimal PAV-score: 6

1 winning committee:
 {c}

Proportional Approval Voting (PAV)
----------------------------------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

starting with the empty committee (score = 0)

adding candidate number 1: c
 score increases by 6 to a total of 6

adding candidate number 2: a
 score increases by 7/2 to a total of 19/2 tie broken in favor of 0 candidates {1} would increase the score by the same amount (7/2)

Optimal PAV-score: 10

1 winning committee:
 {a, b}

 PAV: {c} vs {a, b}

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

starting with the empty committee (score = 0)

adding candidate number 1: c
 score increases by 6 to a total of 6

adding candidate number 2: a
 score increases by 2 to a total of 8 tie broken in favor of 0 candidates {1} would increase the score by the same amount (2)

profile with 18 votes and 4 candidates:
 8 x {a},
 4 x {a, c},

3rd profile:
------------

profile with 4 votes and 6 candidates:
 1 x {a, d, e},
 1 x {a, c},
 1 x {b, e},
 1 x {c, d, f}

winning committees for k=3 and k=4:
 Rule X: {a, c, e} vs {a, b, c, d}


Detailed calculations:
------
Rule X
------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

Phase 1:

starting budget:
  (0.75, 0.75, 0.75, 0.75)

adding candidate number 0: a
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 0.5
 remaining budget:
  (0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75)
 tie broken in favor of a,
 candidates {2, 3, 4} are tied

adding candidate number 1: c
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 0.75
 remaining budget:
  (0.25, 0.0, 0.75, 0.0)
 tie broken in favor of c,
 candidates {3, 4} are tied

adding candidate number 2: e
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 0.75
 remaining budget:
  (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

1 winning committee:
 {a, c, e}

Rule X
------

Computing only one winning committee (resolute=True)

Phase 1:

starting budget:

adding candidate number 0: a
 with maxmimum cost per voter q = 0.5
 remaining budget:
  (0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0)
 tie broken in favor of a,
